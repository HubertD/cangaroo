# cangaroo
open source can bus analyzer

written by Hubert Denkmair <hubert@denkmair.de> (https://github.com/HubertD/cangaroo)

Raw CAN tx support added by Ethan Zonca (https://github.com/normaldotcom/cangaroo)

Pcanng file support added by Skip Hansen (https://github.com/skiphansen/cangaroo)

## building on linux
* to install all required packages in a vanilla ubuntu 16.04:
  * sudo apt-get install build-essential git qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev
* build with:
  * git submodule init;git submodule update
  * qmake -qt=qt5
  * make
  * make install

## building on windows 
* Qt Creator (Community Version is okay) brings everything you need
* except for the PCAN libraries. 
  * Get them from http://www.peak-system.com/fileadmin/media/files/pcan-basic.zip
  * Extract to .zip to src/driver/PeakCanDriver/pcan-basic-api
  * Make sure PCANBasic.dll (the one from pcan-basic-api/Win32 on a "normal" 32bit Windows build)
    is found when running cangaroo, e.g. by putting it in the same folder as the .exe file.
* if you don't want Peak support, you can just disable the driver:
  remove the line "win32:include($$PWD/driver/PeakCanDriver/PeakCanDriver.pri)"
  from src/src.pro
* if you want to deploy the cangaroo app, make sure to also include the needed Qt Libraries.
  for a normal release build, these are: Qt5Core.dll Qt5Gui.dll Qt5Widgets.dll Qt5Xml.dll

**NB: Building on Windows has not been tested on Skip Hansen's fork**

## changelog

### v0.2.1 unreleased
* make logging easier
* refactorings

### v0.2.0 released 2016-01-24
* docking windows system instead of MDI interface
* windows build
* windows PCAN-basic driver
* handle muxed signals in backend and trace window
* do not try to extract signals from messages when DLC too short
* can status window
* bugfixes in setup dialog
* show timestamps, log level etc. in log window

### v0.1.3 released 2016-01-16
* new can interface configuration GUI (missing a suid binary to actually set the config)
* use libnl-route-3 for socketcan device config read
* query socketcan interfaces for supported config options
* new logging subsystem, do not use QDebug any more
* some performance improvements when receiving lots of messages 
* bugfix with time-delta view: timestamps not shown when no previous message avail

### v0.1.2 released 2016-01-12
* fix device re-scan ("could not bind" console message)
* fix some dbc parsing issues (signed signals, ...)
* implement big endian signals

### v0.1.1 released 2016-01-11
* change source structure to better fit debian packaging
* add debian packaging info

### v0.1 released 2016-01-10
initial release \o/



## todo

### backend
* allow for canfd frames
* support non-message frames in traces (e.g. markers)
* implement plugin API
* embed python for scripting

### can drivers
* allow socketcan interface config through suid binary
* socketcan: use hardware timestamps (SIOCSHWTSTAMP) if possible
* cannelloni support
* windows vector driver

### import / export
* export to other file formats (e.g. Vector ASC, BLF, MDF)
* import CAN-Traces

### general ui
* give some style to dock windows
* load/save docks from/to config

### log window
* filter log messages by level

### can status window
* display #warnings, #passive, #busoff, #restarts of socketcan devices

### trace window
* message filtering
* assign colors to can interfaces / messages
* limit displayed number of messages
* show error frames and other non-message frames
* sort signals by startbit, name or position in candb

### raw message generator
* provide a simple way to generate raw can messages

### CanDB based generator
* generate can messages from candbs
* set signals according to value tables etc.
* provide generator functions for signal values
* allow scripting of signal values

### replay window
* replay can traces
* map interfaces in traces to available networks

### graph window
* test QCustomPlot
* allow for graphing of interface stats, message stats and signals

### packaging / deployment
* provide clean debian package
* gentoo ebuild script
* provide static linked binary
* add windows installer
